This is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: `<10>`

### Features
check - Hamburger menu - I couldn't get it to work with a pan gesture so I just used an ugly swipe.
check - Dragging anywhere in the view should reveal the menu.
check - The menu should include links to your profile, the home timeline, and the mentions view.
The menu can look similar to the LinkedIn menu below or feel free to take liberty with the UI.
check - Profile page
check - Contains the user header view
Optional: Implement the paging view for the user description.
Optional: As the paging view moves, increase the opacity of the background screen. See the actual Twitter app for this effect
Optional: Pulling down the profile page should blur and resize the header image.
check - Home Timeline
Tapping on a user image should bring up that user's profile page
